## How to Run
1. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle  
2. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a same folder  
3. Make sure you have Anaconda installed.
Activate your base environment (or another environment with required packages):　conda activate base

Start Jupyter Notebook:　jupyter notebook




## Data
