# Titanic Survival Prediction: A Supervised Learning Project

## Overview
This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict Titanic passenger survival.
It demonstrates the full ML workflow: EDA → Feature Engineering → Model Building → Evaluation.

## How to Run

1. Activate the base environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate base
2. jupyter notebook
