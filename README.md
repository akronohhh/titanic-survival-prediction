# Titanic Survival Prediction: A Supervised Learning Project

## Overview
This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict Titanic passenger survival.
It demonstrates the full ML workflow: EDA → Feature Engineering → Model Building → Evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle  
2. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a same folder  
3. Run the notebook  

0. Activate the base environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate base
0. jupyter notebook




## Data
The dataset is from Kaggle's [Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
Due to licensing, raw data is not uploaded here. Please download it manually and place it into `data/`.
